Requirements:
-------------
To run the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need a version of Autodesk Maya installed.

Supported versions are:

Autodesk Maya 2016
Autodesk Maya 2015
Autodesk Maya 2014
Autodesk Maya 2013
Autodesk Maya 2012
Autodesk Maya 2011

For help on build, please read the BUILD file.

Install:
--------

You have to copy following 3 files:
- Build/Debug 2011/COLLADAMaya.bundle to your Maya plug-in directory.
    The default directory (2011 example) is:
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2011/plug-ins

- scripts/openColladaExporterOpts.mel 
 and scripts/openColladaImporterOpts.mel to your Maya scripts directory.
      The default directory (Maya 2011 example) is
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2011/scripts 

You can also define a environment variable "MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH" and put the 
mll-file into the refered directory. Autodesk Maya will load the plug-ins 
from this directory too.

Execute:
--------
When you start Autodesk Maya, go to the menu 
	Window > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager
and load the plug-in "COLLADAMaya.bundle" from the extended list.
Now you can export your maya scene into a COLLADA file.

Maya plugin loader bug:
-----------------------
Maya error: "Failed to find COLLADA exporter"
It's a known bug that sometimes in some maya versions maya don't recognoize the
last converter on the list. To fix this, load a extra plug-in after the fact 
and it should work.
